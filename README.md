The sales & Operations-Head wants to understand the sales volume growth over the first two-three weeks. Analyze the reasons for dropping the sales volume of sprint scooters. In addition to it calculate click rate for the advertisements made.

MORE DETAILS D1 -Quantifying the sales drop Hey there! Get ready to take on the challenge of quantifying the drop in Sprint scooters' sales volume. You've already familiarized yourself with the dataset, tables, and fields. Now, let's look at the key inputs you need to consider.

The initial two weeks of the launch showed promising sales volume, but thereafter, there was a decline of ~20%.

In this challenge, you need to validate this sales drop by examining the cumulative sales volume over a rolling 7-day period. This approach allows for a consistent evaluation of sales performance throughout the week.

Examine the calculated sales growth percentage to determine if it is negative or shows a decline. This confirms that sales have indeed decreased.

Validating the sales decline is crucial as it provides a clear understanding of the current sales performance. By doing so, you can identify any potential issues or trends that may be affecting sales. This information can then be used to make informed decisions and take necessary actions to address the decline.

Formula to calculate the change in cumulative sales volume over a rolling 7-day period between two consecutive dates, please refer to the following example. It can be a helpful guide when tackling this challenge.

Î”Sales = ((Sales at t - Sales at t-1) / Sales at t-1) Where Sales" represents the cumulative sales volume over the last 7 days, "t" refers to the current time period, and "t-1" represents the previous time period

D2-Analyzing reason for sales decline 1 : Launch date assumption Zoom Electric used to launch its product usually in the first half of the year, Sprint is the only scooter that was launched in the second half of the year( in the month of October).

The objective of this milestone is to assess whether there is a relationship between the launch date and the sales growth experienced in the first two to three weeks.

By comparing the growth percentage of the Sprint Scooter, which has already been calculated during the 'early win challenge', with the growth rate of the Sprint Limited Edition launched on a different production start date, you can validate your assumption about the impact of the launch date.

Specifically, analyzing the growth rate during the first three weeks (21 days) from the launch will provide insights into the validity of your assumption.

D3-Analyzing reason for sales decline 2 : Email analysis The objective of this milestone is to assess the effectiveness of an email campaign in influencing customers' purchasing decisions

Analyzing the email opening rate and click-through rates, as well as comparing them to industry benchmarks, will enable the evaluation of the effectiveness and quality of the email campaign.

This assessment will provide insights into how well the campaign engages recipients, whether they open the emails, and if they click on the provided links, helping to measure the overall impact and success of the campaign.

Additionally, it is essential to consider the following assumptions when conducting this analysis:

Collect email campaign-related data specifically for Sprint scooters.

Include data from the period of 2 months before the sprint model launch, as the digital marketing campaign started only 2 months before the launch.

Connect the two data sets considering that a single customer may have received multiple emails for different products during the campaign.

To calculate the Click Rate, Refer to the following formula:

Click Rate = ( E-mails Clicked ) / ( E-mail sent - Bounced )

Prepare the summary table that shows the comparison between the calculated email opening rate & Click Rate against the benchmark rates. Typically the industry benchmark for a quality campaign is an 18% email opening rate and an 8% Click Rate
